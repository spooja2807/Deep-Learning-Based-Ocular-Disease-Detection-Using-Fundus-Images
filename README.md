# Deep-Learning-Based-Ocular-Disease-Detection-Using-Fundus-Images
Ocular diseases such as Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), Glaucoma (GL), and Cataract (CA)
significantly impact vision and quality of life. This study proposes a deep learning-based multiclass classification system for fundus image analysis using a curated subset of the Eye
Classification Dataset. Unlike traditional preprocessing, our approach combines Wavelet
Transform for multi- resolution feature extraction, Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram
Equalization (CLAHE) for contrast enhancement, and blood vessel segmentation for vascular
structure clarity. Two models—VGG-19 and ConvNeXt—are utilized to effectively capture
both local and hierarchical image features. The proposed system improves classification
performance, with ConvNeXt enhancing hierarchical feature extraction and VGG-19
leveraging deep spatial feature learning.
